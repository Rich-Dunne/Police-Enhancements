## STREET AUDIO
The Street Audio files are used by the DispatchAudio feature.  To use the street audio files, download the STREETS.rar file and copy the files inside to your GTA V directory.

## AMBIENT EVENTS
Ambient events utilize ambient peds, and certain events only use specific peds. If the peds are not present when the event is trying to start, the event will not happen. This does not mean the event is broken.

* **Assault** - Does not use specific peds.  You can experience this event anywhere.
* **Carjacking** - Does not use specific peds.  You can experience this event anywhere.
* **Drug Deal** - Uses Grove, Balla, and Vagos peds.  You'll come across this event in areas where these peds exist.
* **Drive-by** - Uses Grove, Balla, and Vagos peds.  You'll come across this event in areas where these peds exist.
